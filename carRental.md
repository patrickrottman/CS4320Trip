# Transportation
We have chose to rent a vehicle for our trip to Colorado.
## Vehicle Selection
We will be renting a 15 passenger Ford Transit Wagon, allowing us to have plenty of space for hiking equipment and any other belongings for the trip. This rental will be acquired from Enterprise.
## Cost of Transportation
The cost of rent for the vehicle is $142.99 per day, totalling to $467.22 for the trip.
The estimated gas cost for driving this vehicle to and from CO, with extra budgeted for in-state driving between destinations is $350. This brings the total cost of transportation to **$817.22** for the entire trip.
