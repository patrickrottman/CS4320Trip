Our purpose will be to tackle two of Colorado's tallest mountains. The first of our weekend trip will be to day hike the tallest mountain in the Rockies, Mt. Elbert at 14,440 ft above sea level. The next day, we will climb Colorado's second tallest, Mt. Massive at 14,421 ft above sea level. After climbing each day, we will enjoy eachother's company at the nearby town of Leadville, CO, the highest elevation city in the US.
