## Destination:
Leadville, Colorado

## Budget:
$500 Per Person

$3500 Total

## Length:
* Weekend Trip. Friday evening to Sunday evening. Technically 2 days.

## Purpose:
Our purpose will be to tackle two of Colorado's tallest mountains. The first of our weekend trip will be to day hike the tallest mountain in the Rockies, Mt. Elbert at 14,440 ft above sea level. The next day, we will climb Colorado's second tallest, Mt. Massive at 14,421 ft above sea level. After climbing each day, we will enjoy eachother's company at the nearby town of Leadville, CO, the highest elevation city in the US.

## Trails:
We will be summitting Mt. Elbert on the first day, taking the traditional class 1 trail, the Northeast ridge. This is a well travelled trail so we will see many hikers along the way. We will plan to begin the hike at 8am, summit around 11:30am, and be off of the trail by 3pm.

The next day we will summit Mt. Massive. While this mountain is less tall, the trail is more difficult, as a class 2. We will plan to begin the hike at 7am, summit around 11:30am, and be off of the trail by 4pm.
