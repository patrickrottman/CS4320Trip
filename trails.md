## Trails:
We will be summitting Mt. Elbert on the first day, taking the traditional class 1 trail, the Northeast ridge. This is a well travelled trail so we will see many hikers along the way. We will plan to begin the hike at 8am, summit around 11:30am, and be off of the trail by 3pm.

The next day we will summit Mt. Massive. While this mountain is less tall, the trail is more difficult, as a class 2. We will plan to begin the hike at 7am, summit around 11:30am, and be off of the trail by 4pm.
